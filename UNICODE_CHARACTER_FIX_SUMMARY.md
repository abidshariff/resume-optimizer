# Unicode Character Issue Resolution

## Problem
The PDF generator was failing with the error:
```
Error generating PDF document: Character "•" at index 7 in text is outside the range of characters supported by the font used: "helvetica". Please consider using a Unicode font.
```

## Root Cause
1. **Bullet Character Issue**: The PDF generator was using `' • '.join(clean_skills)` to join skills, which added bullet characters back into the text AFTER cleaning them.
2. **Font Compatibility**: The Helvetica font in fpdf2 has limited Unicode support for special characters.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Bullet Character Usage
- **Before**: `skills_text = ' • '.join(clean_skills)` (line 201)
- **After**: `skills_text = ' * '.join(clean_skills)` (using asterisk instead)

### 2. Enhanced Unicode Character Cleaning
Added more comprehensive character replacements in `clean_text_for_pdf()`:
```python
replacements = {
    '•': '*',  # Bullet point - use asterisk instead
    '◦': '*',  # White bullet
    '▪': '*',  # Black small square
    '▫': '*',  # White small square
    '‣': '*',  # Triangular bullet
    '⁃': '*',  # Hyphen bullet
    # ... other Unicode characters
}
```

### 3. Font Improvements
- Changed from `Helvetica` to `Arial` font throughout the PDF generator
- fpdf2 automatically falls back to core fonts with better Unicode handling

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Created `test_unicode_fix.py` to verify the fix works
- Test includes resume data with bullet characters in skills and achievements
- Successfully generates PDF without Unicode errors

## Files Modified
- `backend/lambda-functions/ai-handler/pdf_generator.py`
  - Fixed bullet character joining in skills section
  - Enhanced Unicode character replacement dictionary
  - Changed all font references from Helvetica to Arial
  - Improved character cleaning function

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Lambda function `ResumeOptimizerAIHandler-prod`
- Changes are immediately effective for new PDF generation requests

## Testing Results
✅ PDF generation now works without Unicode errors
✅ Bullet characters are properly converted to asterisks
✅ All special characters are cleaned and replaced with safe alternatives
✅ Email addresses and other important text remain intact

## Impact
- Resolves PDF generation failures caused by Unicode characters
- Improves reliability of resume and cover letter PDF downloads
- Maintains professional formatting while ensuring compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Prevention
The enhanced `clean_text_for_pdf()` function now handles a comprehensive set of Unicode characters, preventing similar issues in the future.
