# Cover Letter Fix Test Results

## Issue Fixed
The cover letter generation was using the **original resume** instead of the **AI-optimized resume**.

## Solution Implemented
Changed line 1566 in `backend/lambda-functions/ai-handler/index.py`:

**Before:**
```python
Resume Content: {resume_text[:2000]}...
```

**After:**
```python
Resume Content: {create_text_resume(resume_json)[:2000] if 'resume_json' in locals() and resume_json else resume_text[:2000]}...
```

## Expected Improvement

### Before Fix:
- Cover letter emphasized **Data Engineering skills** (Python, SQL, cloud platform engineering)
- Used **original resume content** that wasn't tailored for the target role
- **Career transition not addressed** properly

### After Fix:
- Cover letter will use **AI-optimized resume content** that's already tailored for the Recruiter role
- Will emphasize **recruiting-relevant skills** (stakeholder management, process optimization, analytics for talent acquisition)
- **Career transition** will be properly addressed since the optimized resume handles this

## Test Case
**Scenario**: Data Engineer applying for Recruiter position at Apple

**Expected Cover Letter Content After Fix**:
- Should emphasize experience with **talent acquisition teams**
- Should highlight **stakeholder management** and **process optimization**
- Should focus on **data-driven recruiting** rather than technical data engineering
- Should address the **career transition** naturally

## Deployment Status
✅ **Successfully deployed** to AWS Lambda function `ResumeOptimizerAIHandler-prod`
✅ **Code size**: 221,687 bytes
✅ **Last modified**: 2025-08-06T02:13:44.000+0000

## Next Steps
1. Test with a real Data Engineer → Recruiter application
2. Verify the cover letter content uses optimized resume
3. Confirm career transition is properly addressed
4. Monitor for any edge cases or fallback scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Function**: Uses `create_text_resume(resume_json)` to convert optimized JSON to text
- **Fallback**: Falls back to original resume if optimized version unavailable
- **Character limit**: Still respects 2000 character limit for prompt efficiency
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
