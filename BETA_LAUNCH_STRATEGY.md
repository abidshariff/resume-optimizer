Title: "I built an AI tool that tailors resumes to job postings - free beta"

Hey everyone! I'm a developer who got frustrated with generic resume advice, so I built an AI-powered tool that automatically optimizes resumes for specific job postings.

Features:
â€¢ AI analyzes job descriptions and optimizes your resume
â€¢ Shows before/after comparison
â€¢ Highlights key improvements
â€¢ Currently 100% free during beta

I'm looking for feedback from people actively job searching. Would love to hear what you think!
