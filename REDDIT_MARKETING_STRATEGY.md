## **Reddit Post Templates**

### **Template 1: Problem-Solution Story**
```
Title: "I got tired of generic resume advice, so I built an AI tool that actually works"

Hey r/jobs! 

Like many of you, I was frustrated with the generic "use action words" resume advice that doesn't actually help you stand out.

So I built an AI tool that analyzes specific job postings and tells you exactly how to optimize your resume for each application.

Here's what it does:
‚Ä¢ Analyzes the job description with AI
‚Ä¢ Identifies missing keywords and skills
‚Ä¢ Suggests specific improvements
‚Ä¢ Shows before/after comparison

I've been testing it with friends and they're getting 2-3x more interview callbacks.

It's completely free right now while I'm gathering feedback. Would love to hear what you think!

Happy to answer any questions about resume optimization or the tool!

### **Template 2: Value-First Approach**
```
Title: "Free AI resume analysis - I'll review 10 resumes and show you the optimization"

Hey everyone!

I built an AI resume optimizer and want to demonstrate how it works. I'll take the first 10 people who comment and show you:

1. What your resume is missing for specific jobs
2. Keyword gaps that might be hurting you
3. Specific improvements to make
4. Before/after comparison

Just comment with:
- Your target job title
- Industry you're targeting
- One challenge you're facing

I'll run your resume through the AI and share the results!

Tool: [your link] (free while in beta)
```

### **Template 3: Success Story**
```
Title: "Update: The AI resume tool helped me get 5 interviews in 2 weeks"

Original post: [link to previous post]

Quick update for anyone who tried the AI resume optimizer I shared last month.

Results after using it for 2 weeks:
‚Ä¢ Applied to 15 jobs (vs 50+ before)
‚Ä¢ Got 5 interview requests (vs 1-2 before)
‚Ä¢ Much more targeted applications
‚Ä¢ Saved hours of manual customization

The biggest insight: I was missing industry-specific keywords that the AI caught immediately.

For anyone still job searching, the tool is still free: [link]

Thanks to everyone who gave feedback - it really helped improve the tool!
