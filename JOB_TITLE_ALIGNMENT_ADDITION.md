# Job Title Alignment Section Added to Prompt Template

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Added**

A new dedicated section **"JOB TITLE ALIGNMENT IN EXPERIENCE"** has been added to the prompt template to ensure the AI systematically updates job titles in the experience section.

3. **JOB TITLE ALIGNMENT IN EXPERIENCE**:
   - Update job titles in the experience section to align with the target "{job_title}" role
   - Use progressive title evolution showing growth toward the target position (e.g., "Software Engineer" â†’ "Senior Software Engineer" â†’ "Lead Software Engineer")
   - Replace generic titles with industry-standard titles that match the target role terminology
   - Ensure consistency in title terminology throughout the resume
   - Maintain truthfulness while using more relevant and impactful job titles
