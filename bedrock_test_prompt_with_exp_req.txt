üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES - READ FIRST üö®üö®üö®

‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- Removing ANY company from work history
- Omitting ANY job experience from the original resume
- Skipping ANY employment entry
- Combining multiple jobs into one entry
- Deleting ANY work experience regardless of relevance
- Modifying ANY education entries (degree names, institutions, dates, details)

‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include EVERY SINGLE company mentioned in the original resume
- Preserve EVERY job entry structure (company, title, dates) from the original
- Maintain the COMPLETE work history timeline
- Keep ALL employment dates exactly as written
- Keep ALL education entries EXACTLY as written (degrees, institutions, dates, GPA, honors, details)
- TRANSFORM and OPTIMIZE all bullet point content for the target role
- NEVER remove entire job entries
- NEVER modify education section content

üö® STEP 1: ANALYZE ORIGINAL RESUME STRUCTURE üö®

Before optimizing, you MUST analyze the original resume and identify:

1. **Count all bullet points/achievement statements** in the experience section
   - Look for: explicit bullets (‚Ä¢, -, *), numbered lists (1., 2.), indented achievements, paragraph-style accomplishments
   - Include ALL types: traditional bullets, achievement statements, responsibility descriptions, accomplishment paragraphs
   - Count EVERYTHING that describes work activities, achievements, or responsibilities

2. **Count all job entries** in work history
   - Each company/position combination = 1 job entry
   - Include ALL employment, even short-term or less relevant positions

3. **Analyze structure per job**
   - How many achievement/bullet statements does each job have?
   - What's the format (bullets, paragraphs, numbered lists)?

üö® STEP 2: STRUCTURE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT üö®

Your output MUST have:
- EXACT same number of job entries as original
- EXACT same number of achievement statements per job as original
- SAME overall structure (if original has 4 jobs with 3, 5, 2, 4 bullets respectively, output must have 4 jobs with 3, 5, 2, 4 bullets)

CAREER TRANSITION ASSESSMENT:
Analyze if this is a major career transition vs. career advancement:
- Current: Data Engineering Manager  
- Target: Senior Software Engineer

This is CAREER ADVANCEMENT (Same Domain, Higher Level/Management to Senior IC):
- Reframe existing work to show technical leadership and senior-level impact
- Transform management work to show technical expertise: "Led team of 12 engineers" ‚Üí "Architected scalable systems while mentoring junior developers"
- Emphasize technical depth, system design, and engineering excellence
- Use senior technical action verbs: Architected, Led, Spearheaded, Drove, Established, Mentored, Pioneered
- Example: "Managed cross-functional team" ‚Üí "Architected distributed systems, leading technical design decisions and mentoring engineering teams"

üö® ACTION VERB REQUIREMENTS üö®:
- SENIOR IC ROLES: Must use "Architected, Led, Spearheaded, Drove, Established, Mentored, Pioneered"
- MID-LEVEL ROLES: Use "Developed, Built, Implemented, Created, Designed, Optimized, Delivered"
- NEVER use "Managed, Supervised, Coordinated" for IC roles - these are management verbs
