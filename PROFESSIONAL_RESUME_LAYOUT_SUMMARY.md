```

### ✅ **Bullet Points**

### ✅ **Font and Spacing**
- Arial font with Helvetica fallback for better compatibility
- Optimized font sizes: Name (16pt), Headers (12pt), Body (11pt)
- Proper spacing between sections and items

## Technical Implementation

### Experience Section Structure
```python
# Line 1: Company name (left) and dates (right)
pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 11)
company_width = pdf.get_string_width(company)
dates_width = pdf.get_string_width(dates)
available_width = pdf.w - pdf.l_margin - pdf.r_margin

# Company name on the left
pdf.cell(company_width, 5, company, ln=False)

# Dates on the right
x_pos = pdf.l_margin + available_width - dates_width
pdf.set_x(x_pos)
pdf.cell(dates_width, 5, dates, ln=True)

# Line 2: Job title (left) and location (right)
pdf.set_font('Arial', '', 11)
# ... similar alignment logic
```

### Bullet Point Implementation
```python
# Achievements with proper text wrapping
pdf.cell(5, 5, '-', ln=False)  # Dash bullet point
remaining_width = pdf.w - pdf.l_margin - pdf.r_margin - 5
pdf.multi_cell(remaining_width, 5, f' {clean_achievement}')
```
