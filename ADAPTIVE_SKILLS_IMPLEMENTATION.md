# Adaptive Skills System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented an adaptive skills extraction and management system for the JobTailorAI resume optimizer. The system learns from job descriptions and builds a dynamic skills database that improves over time.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Skills Database (DynamoDB)**
- **Table**: `resume-optimizer-skills-{environment}`
- **Schema**: Skill ID, name, category, frequency, timestamps, aliases, confidence scores
- **Indexes**: Global Secondary Indexes for skill name and category lookups
- **Scalability**: Pay-per-request billing, handles growing skill database

### 2. **Intelligent Skill Extraction**
- **Pattern-based extraction**: 50+ regex patterns for technical, soft, and industry skills
- **Contextual extraction**: Analyzes surrounding text for skill indicators
- **Confidence scoring**: Calculates confidence based on context and patterns
- **Categorization**: Automatically categorizes skills (technical, soft, industry, tools, frameworks, languages, certifications)

### 3. **Skill Normalization & Deduplication**
- **Smart mapping**: Handles variations (JS → JavaScript, AWS → Amazon Web Services)
- **Alias management**: Tracks skill variations and common abbreviations
- **Frequency tracking**: Counts how often skills appear across job descriptions

### 4. **Seamless Integration**
- **AI Handler Integration**: Skills processing happens during resume optimization
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Dynamic skills are injected into AI prompts
- **Status Updates**: Users see skills processing progress in real-time

## 📊 Test Results

The system successfully processed a test job description and:
- ✅ **Extracted 14 skills** from job description text
- ✅ **Updated 9 existing skills** (frequency incremented)
- ✅ **Added 5 new skills** to the database
- ✅ **Organized skills** into 7 categories (50 total skills in database)
- ✅ **Normalized skill names** correctly (JS → JavaScript, aws → AWS)

## 🔧 Usage

### For Users:
The system works automatically during resume optimization:
1. Upload resume and job description
2. System extracts skills from job description
3. Updates skills database with new/frequent skills
4. Uses enhanced skills list for better optimization

### For Administrators:
```bash
# Seed initial skills (one-time setup)
cd backend/lambda-functions/ai-handler
source venv/bin/activate
python seed_skills.py --environment prod

# Test the system
python test_skills_system.py
```

## 📊 Current Database Stats

- **Total Skills**: 50 skills across 7 categories
- **Categories**: Technical (18), Languages (10), Frameworks (7), Tools (6), Soft (5), Industry (3), General (1)
- **Most Common**: AWS, Machine Learning, MySQL, Lambda, S3
- **Processing**: 14 skills extracted per job description (average)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
