    You are an expert ATS resume optimizer and career consultant. Your mission is to COMPLETELY TRANSFORM the provided resume to perfectly match the job description while maintaining truthfulness about the candidate's background.

    ORIGINAL RESUME:
    {resume_text}

    TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:
    {job_description}

    EXTRACTED KEY TECHNOLOGIES/SKILLS FROM JOB: {', '.join(job_keywords) if job_keywords else 'General skills optimization'}

    ORIGINAL RESUME LENGTH: Approximately {original_page_count} page(s)
    ORIGINAL RESUME STRUCTURE: {original_structure['total_lines']} lines, {original_structure['bullet_points']} bullet points, estimated {original_structure['estimated_experience_sections']} experience sections

    ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENT:
    **SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE MUST BE PERFECTLY ALIGNED**
    - If you add "Google Cloud" to skills, experience bullets MUST mention Google Cloud projects/work
    - If you add "React" to skills, experience bullets MUST show React development work
    - If you add "Python" to skills, experience bullets MUST demonstrate Python usage
    - NO SKILL should appear in the skills section without corresponding evidence in experience bullets

    CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:

    1. **TECHNOLOGY SUBSTITUTION AND ALIGNMENT**: 
       - IDENTIFY similar technologies between original resume and job requirements
       - SUBSTITUTE original technologies with job-required ones where logical
       - Example: If original mentions "AWS Lambda" and job needs "Google Cloud Functions", 
         change experience bullets to mention "Google Cloud Functions" instead
       - Example: If original mentions "MySQL" and job needs "PostgreSQL",
         update experience bullets to mention "PostgreSQL" work
       - ENSURE every skill in the skills section has supporting evidence in experience bullets

    2. **AGGRESSIVE KEYWORD INTEGRATION WITH EVIDENCE**: 
       - Identify ALL technical skills, tools, frameworks from job description
       - For EACH skill added to skills section, CREATE corresponding experience bullet evidence
       - Transform existing experience bullets to incorporate new technologies naturally
       - If candidate worked with similar technology, reframe using job description terminology
       - Add specific project examples using job-required technologies

    3. **COMPLETE EXPERIENCE TRANSFORMATION WITH TECHNOLOGY FOCUS**:
       - REWRITE every bullet point to include job-relevant technologies
       - Replace original technology mentions with job-required equivalents
       - Transform generic accomplishments into technology-specific achievements
       - Use exact technology names from job description
       - Quantify achievements with technology-specific metrics
       - Focus on impact using the technologies mentioned in job posting

    4. **CROSS-SECTION VALIDATION**:
       - After creating skills section, VERIFY each skill has evidence in experience
       - After creating experience section, VERIFY it supports all listed skills
       - Remove any skills that cannot be supported by experience bullets
       - Add experience details for any skills that lack supporting evidence

    5. **STRATEGIC SKILL ENHANCEMENT WITH PROOF**:
       - Add technical skills from job description that candidate likely has
       - For EACH new skill added, modify at least one experience bullet to show usage
       - Reorganize skills to prioritize job-relevant technologies
       - Use exact terminology from job description
       - Ensure skills section and experience section tell the same story

    6. **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY TECHNOLOGY ALIGNMENT**:
       - Mention ONLY technologies that appear in both skills and experience sections
       - Include years of experience with job-relevant technologies
       - Highlight specific technology combinations mentioned in job posting
       - Ensure summary reflects the technology focus shown in experience

    7. **CONTENT PRESERVATION AND PRIORITIZATION**:
       - {length_guidance}
       - **PRESERVE ALL EXPERIENCE ENTRIES** from the original resume
       - **PRESERVE ALL BULLET POINTS** for each job - do not reduce the number
       - **MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL** as the original resume
       - Transform existing content to include job-relevant technologies
       - Substitute similar technologies rather than adding unrelated ones

    8. **ATS OPTIMIZATION WITH CONSISTENCY**:
       - Use exact phrases from job description in both skills and experience
       - Ensure keyword density is high but natural across all sections
       - Maintain consistent technology terminology throughout resume
       - Format for maximum ATS compatibility

    9. **EDUCATION PRESERVATION**:
       - **DO NOT MODIFY THE EDUCATION SECTION**
       - Keep all education entries exactly as they appear in the original resume

    ðŸ”§ TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:

    **Example 1: Cloud Platform Substitution**
    - Original Skill: "AWS"
    - Job Requires: "Google Cloud Platform"
    - Skills Section: Add "Google Cloud Platform, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage"

      - Original: "Deployed applications on AWS EC2 instances"
      - New: "Deployed applications on Google Cloud Compute Engine instances"
      - Original: "Used AWS S3 for file storage"
      - New: "Implemented file storage solutions using Google Cloud Storage"

    **Example 2: Programming Language Focus**
    - Original Skill: "Java"
    - Job Requires: "Python"
    - Skills Section: Emphasize "Python, Django, Flask, pandas"

    - Job Requires: "PostgreSQL"
    - Skills Section: Add "PostgreSQL, SQL optimization, database design"
    - Experience Transformation:
      - Original: "Managed MySQL databases"
