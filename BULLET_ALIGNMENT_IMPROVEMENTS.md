# Bullet Point Alignment Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Excessive Space Between Bullet and Text**
**Problem**: Too much gap between the bullet point and the text
**Solution**: 
- Reduced bullet cell width from `5` to `3` units
- Removed extra space in text by using `clean_achievement` instead of `f' {clean_achievement}'`

### 2. **Poor Text Alignment on Wrapped Lines**
**Problem**: When text wrapped to the next line, it didn't align properly with the first line
**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper indentation using `pdf.set_x(text_x)` 
- Set consistent text position at `pdf.l_margin + 3` (bullet width)
- This ensures wrapped text aligns perfectly with the first line

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Poor Alignment):
```python
pdf.cell(5, 4, '•', ln=False)  # Too wide
remaining_width = pdf.w - pdf.l_margin - pdf.r_margin - 5
pdf.multi_cell(remaining_width, 4, f' {clean_achievement}')  # Extra space + poor alignment
```

### After (Perfect Alignment):
```python
# Add bullet with minimal width
pdf.cell(3, 4, chr(183), ln=False)  # Smaller width

# Set proper text position for alignment
text_x = pdf.l_margin + 3  # Bullet width
pdf.set_x(text_x)

# Multi-cell with proper indentation
remaining_width = pdf.w - pdf.l_margin - pdf.r_margin - 3
pdf.multi_cell(remaining_width, 4, clean_achievement)  # No extra space, perfect alignment
```
