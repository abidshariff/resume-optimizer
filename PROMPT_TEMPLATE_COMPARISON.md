## üìã Current Template vs Enhanced Template

### üîç **CURRENT TEMPLATE** (Basic)

```python
def create_cover_letter_prompt(resume_text, job_description, job_title, company_name):
    company_info = f" at {company_name}" if company_name else ""
    job_desc_section = f"""
TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}
""" if job_description else """
GENERAL PROFESSIONAL COVER LETTER:

"""
    
    prompt = f"""You are an expert cover letter writer. Create a compelling, personalized cover letter for the "{job_title}" position{company_info}.

CANDIDATE'S RESUME:
{resume_text}

{job_desc_section}

COVER LETTER REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Professional Format**: Use standard business letter format
2. **Personalization**: Address the specific role and company (if provided)
3. **Relevant Experience**: Highlight the most relevant experience from the resume
4. **Skills Alignment**: Emphasize skills that match the job requirements
5. **Professional Tone**: Confident but not arrogant, enthusiastic but professional
6. **Length**: 3-4 paragraphs, approximately 250-400 words
7. **Call to Action**: End with a strong closing that requests an interview
