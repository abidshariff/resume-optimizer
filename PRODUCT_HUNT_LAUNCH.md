ðŸš€ JobTailorAI Pro is live on Product Hunt!

After seeing friends struggle with generic resume advice, I built an AI tool that tailors resumes to specific job postings.

âœ¨ What it does:
â€¢ Analyzes job descriptions with AI
â€¢ Optimizes your resume for each application
â€¢ Shows before/after comparisons
â€¢ Increases interview callbacks

We're currently #3 and climbing! Your support would mean the world.
