# ðŸ’¼ LinkedIn Marketing Strategy for JobTailorAI

## **Content Strategy**

### **1. Personal Story Posts (High Engagement)**
```
I spent 6 months watching friends struggle with job applications...

They'd send out 100+ resumes and get maybe 2-3 interviews.

The problem? Generic resumes that don't match what employers actually want.

So I built an AI tool that analyzes job postings and optimizes resumes specifically for each application.

Early results from beta testers:
â†’ 3x more interview callbacks
â†’ 50% less time spent on applications  
â†’ Better job-resume matching

The tool is free while I gather feedback: [link]

### **2. Educational Content**
```
5 resume mistakes that kill your job applications:

1. Using the same resume for every job
â†’ Customize for each role's keywords

2. Focusing on duties instead of achievements  
â†’ Use numbers and results

3. Ignoring ATS optimization
â†’ Use relevant keywords from job posting

4. Generic objective statements
â†’ Tailor to specific company/role

5. Poor formatting for ATS systems
â†’ Use clean, simple layouts

I built an AI tool that catches these automatically: [link]
