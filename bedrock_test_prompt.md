üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES - READ FIRST üö®üö®üö®

‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- Removing ANY company from work history
- Omitting ANY job experience from the original resume
- Skipping ANY employment entry
- Combining multiple jobs into one entry
- Deleting ANY work experience regardless of relevance
- Modifying ANY education entries (degree names, institutions, dates, details)

‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include EVERY SINGLE company mentioned in the original resume
- Preserve EVERY job entry structure (company, title, dates) from the original
- Maintain the COMPLETE work history timeline
- Keep ALL employment dates exactly as written
- Keep ALL education entries EXACTLY as written (degrees, institutions, dates, GPA, honors, details)
- TRANSFORM and OPTIMIZE all bullet point content for the target role
- NEVER remove entire job entries
- NEVER modify education section content

üö® STEP 1: ANALYZE ORIGINAL RESUME STRUCTURE üö®

Before optimizing, you MUST analyze the original resume and identify:

1. **Count all bullet points/achievement statements** in the experience section
   - Look for: explicit bullets (‚Ä¢, -, *), numbered lists (1., 2.), indented achievements, paragraph-style accomplishments
   - Include ALL types: traditional bullets, achievement statements, responsibility descriptions, accomplishment paragraphs
   - Count EVERYTHING that describes work activities, achievements, or responsibilities

2. **Count all job entries** in work history
   - Each company/position combination = 1 job entry
   - Include ALL employment, even short-term or less relevant positions

3. **Analyze structure per job**
   - How many achievement/bullet statements does each job have?
   - What's the format (bullets, paragraphs, numbered lists)?

üö® STEP 2: STRUCTURE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT üö®

Your output MUST have:
- EXACT same number of job entries as original
- EXACT same number of achievement statements per job as original
- SAME overall structure (if original has 4 jobs with 3, 5, 2, 4 bullets respectively, output must have 4 jobs with 3, 5, 2, 4 bullets)

BULLET POINT MODIFICATION STRATEGY:

IF MAJOR CAREER TRANSITION (Different Domains/Fields/Industries):
   - Job description provided: Completely rewrite each bullet using job technologies: {job_keywords}
   - Transform the story to show transferable skills for {job_title}
   - Example: "Designed mechanical systems for automotive" ‚Üí "Developed systematic solutions using Python and SQL for data processing applications"
   - Keep achievements/metrics but change the domain completely
   - Use appropriate action verbs for target role: {appropriate_verbs}

IF CAREER ADVANCEMENT (Same Domain, Higher Level/Management):
   - Job description provided: Reframe existing work to show leadership and higher-level impact
   - Transform IC work to show management capabilities: "Built feature" ‚Üí "Led development of feature, mentoring 3 junior developers"
   - Emphasize team leadership, strategic thinking, and business impact
   - Use management action verbs: Led, Managed, Mentored, Coordinated, Directed, Supervised, Guided, Strategized
   - Example: "Developed API endpoints" ‚Üí "Led API development initiative, coordinating with 3 teams and mentoring junior developers"

IF SAME/RELATED ROLE (Lateral or Skill Expansion):
   - Job description provided: Keep original story/context, update technologies: {job_keywords}
   - Example: "Built data pipeline using MySQL" ‚Üí "Built data pipeline using PostgreSQL"
   - Preserve the work context, enhance with job-relevant tools
   - Use appropriate action verbs for seniority level: {appropriate_verbs}

üö® ACTION VERB REQUIREMENTS üö®:
- MANAGEMENT ROLES: Must use "Led, Managed, Mentored, Coordinated, Directed, Supervised, Guided, Strategized"
- SENIOR IC ROLES: Must use "Architected, Led, Spearheaded, Drove, Established, Mentored, Pioneered"
- MID-LEVEL ROLES: Use "Developed, Built, Implemented, Created, Designed, Optimized, Delivered"
- JUNIOR ROLES: Use "Assisted, Supported, Contributed, Participated, Collaborated, Learned"
- NEVER use "Implemented, Developed, Built" for management roles - these are IC verbs

üö® STEP 3: STRUCTURE VERIFICATION üö®

Before providing your final output, INTERNALLY verify your analysis (do not include this in the JSON):
- Count: Original resume has X job entries with Y total achievement statements
- Verify: Job 1 has Z achievement statements, Job 2 has W achievement statements, etc.
- Confirm: My output has X job entries with Y total achievement statements (EXACT MATCH)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY - NO ANALYSIS TEXT):
{
  "full_name": "Name from resume",
  "contact_info": "Email | Phone | Location", 
  "professional_summary": "{summary_guidance}",
  "skills": ["Technologies relevant to {job_title}"],
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "RESEARCH-BASED title that actually exists at this specific company for {job_title} progression",
      "company": "EXACT company name - NEVER CHANGE THIS",
      "dates": "EXACT dates - NEVER CHANGE THIS",
      "achievements": [
        "Bullet 1 - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN and optimized for {job_title} role using appropriate action verbs",
        "Bullet 2 - TRANSFORMED content using career transition strategy", 
        "Bullet 3 - ENHANCED with relevant technologies and impact metrics",
        "MUST have EXACT same number of bullets as original job but FULLY OPTIMIZED content"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "EXACT from original - NEVER CHANGE ANYTHING",
      "institution": "EXACT from original - NEVER CHANGE ANYTHING", 
      "dates": "EXACT from original - NEVER CHANGE ANYTHING",
      "details": "EXACT from original if present - NEVER CHANGE ANYTHING (GPA, honors, coursework, etc.)"
    }
  ]
}

üö® CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object above. Do NOT include any analysis text, explanations, or structure verification in your response. The structure analysis should be done internally to guide your work, but not included in the output.
