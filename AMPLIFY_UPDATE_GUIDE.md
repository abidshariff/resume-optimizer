# Amplify Configuration Update Guide

## 🚀 **Frontend Deployment Complete!**

Your frontend has been successfully updated with asynchronous processing and pushed to GitHub. Here's what you need to do to complete the deployment:

## 📋 **Required Amplify Updates**

### 1. **Update Environment Variables**

In your AWS Amplify Console, update the following environment variables:

```bash
# Your current API endpoint (no change needed)
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=https://3bemzv60ge.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

# Your current Cognito settings (no change needed)
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_Hgs2gd3iK
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID=6ql99bmnbe2fr2dcl8n5cda3de
```

### 2. **Amplify Configuration (src/aws-exports.js or similar)**

Make sure your Amplify configuration includes the API configuration:

```javascript
const awsconfig = {
  Auth: {
    region: 'us-east-1',
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_Hgs2gd3iK',
    userPoolWebClientId: '6ql99bmnbe2fr2dcl8n5cda3de',
  },
  API: {
    endpoints: [
      {
        name: 'resumeOptimizer',
        endpoint: 'https://3bemzv60ge.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev',
        region: 'us-east-1'
      }
    ]
  }
};

export default awsconfig;
```

## 🔄 **New API Endpoints Available**

Your application now uses these endpoints:

1. **POST /optimize** - Submit resume optimization job (returns immediately)
2. **GET /status?jobId=xxx** - Check job status (polls every 3 seconds)

## ✅ **What's Already Done**

- ✅ **Frontend updated** with asynchronous processing
- ✅ **Lambda functions deployed** with async support
- ✅ **Status checker Lambda** created and deployed
- ✅ **API Gateway** updated with /status endpoint
- ✅ **Code pushed to GitHub** - Amplify will auto-deploy

## 🎯 **Expected User Experience**

1. **Upload Resume** → User uploads file and enters job description
2. **Submit Job** → Gets immediate response with job ID (< 1 second)
3. **Real-time Status** → Progress indicator shows processing status
4. **Completion** → Download link appears when ready (30-60 seconds)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Amplify Build Logs** - Look for any build errors
2. **Verify Environment Variables** - Ensure all variables are set correctly
3. **Test API Endpoints** - Use browser dev tools to check network requests
4. **Check Lambda Logs** - CloudWatch logs for debugging

## 📱 **Testing the New Flow**

1. Upload a resume and job description
2. Click "Optimize Resume"
3. You should see:
   - Immediate "Job submitted" message
   - Progress indicator with status updates
   - "What's happening?" information box
   - Download button when complete

## 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

- ❌ **No more timeouts** (31s Lambda vs 29s API Gateway)
- ✅ **Better UX** with immediate feedback
- ✅ **Real-time progress** updates
- ✅ **Scalable** processing for multiple users
- ✅ **Reliable** long-running operations

Your resume optimizer is now production-ready with asynchronous processing!
