# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Resume Optimizer application is currently experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when the frontend hosted on Amplify attempts to make API requests to the API Gateway endpoint. This prevents users from successfully optimizing their resumes. This feature will implement the necessary CORS configuration changes to allow the frontend application to communicate with the backend API successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Resume Optimizer application, I want to be able to submit my resume and job description from the frontend application and receive an optimized resume without encountering CORS errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a resume and job description from the frontend application THEN the API should accept the request without CORS errors.
2. WHEN the frontend application makes a preflight OPTIONS request THEN the API should respond with appropriate CORS headers.
3. WHEN the frontend application makes a POST request THEN the API should respond with appropriate CORS headers.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the CORS configuration is properly implemented across all environments (dev, test, prod) to ensure consistent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CloudFormation template is deployed THEN the API Gateway should be configured with the correct CORS settings for all environments.
2. WHEN Lambda functions return responses THEN they should include the necessary CORS headers.
3. WHEN the API Gateway is updated THEN existing resources should maintain their functionality while gaining proper CORS support.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to easily configure which domains are allowed to access the API to maintain security while enabling necessary access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN there should be a configurable way to specify allowed origins.
2. IF specific domains need to be allowed THEN the configuration should support listing specific domains rather than using a wildcard.
3. WHEN the allowed origins need to be updated THEN it should be possible without redeploying the entire stack.
